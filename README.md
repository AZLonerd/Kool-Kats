# Kool Kats: The Tale of Two Tails

**Team:** Daniel Ayoung-Chee, Ziwei “May” Tang, Joshua Lee, Yuang Zhang  


## Overview
Kool Kats compares cats and dogs across media, research, ownership, and consumer markets.  
The project uses data analysis and visual storytelling to show how dogs dominate in research, content, and product variety, while cats face fewer options and higher costs despite comparable adoption and affection levels.


## Research Focus
We explored the following questions:
- Which animal appears more in movies, media, and online platforms?  
- How do adoption and ownership rates compare across U.S. states?  
- Are pet products for cats or dogs more expensive or more varied?  
- Is there more academic research about dogs than cats?

## Key Insights
1. Dog movies outnumber cat movies (370 vs 265) and earn roughly 2.5 times more revenue.  
2. Dog movies average higher ratings (3.71 vs 3.53).  
3. Dogs dominate YouTube and TikTok; cats lead slightly in Wikipedia page views.  
4. Cats are adopted slightly more often from shelters, but dogs are owned more overall.  
5. Dog products are more varied; cat products are more expensive.  
6. There is significantly more research about dogs than cats.  


## Data Storyline
**Hook:** Movie revenue comparison showing that dog films consistently earn more.  
**Rising Insight:** Movie ratings show a small but consistent advantage for dogs.  
**Main Message:** Ownership, adoption, and social media popularity visualized through maps and dashboards.  
**Call to Action:** Product and cost inequality visualized through an interactive shopping basket comparison.  


## Implementation Summary
**Tools Used:** D3.js, Tableau, Python (Pandas), GitHub  

**Contributors and Work:**  
- **Daniel Ayoung-Chee:** Movie data analysis and visualization  
- **Ziwei “May” Tang:** Ownership and adoption data visualization  
- **Joshua Lee:** Product variety and pricing comparison  
- **Yuang Zhang:** Social media and online popularity visualizations  


## Findings and Takeaways
- Dogs lead in visibility, research, and product availability.  
- Cats face higher costs and less variety despite similar adoption rates.  
- Media and research bias contribute to the perception that dogs are more socially integrated.  

**Conclusion:**  
To balance perception, there should be greater attention to feline-focused research, improved product diversity, and fairer media representation.
