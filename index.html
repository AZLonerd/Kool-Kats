        <h4> Introduction: Movie Statistics </h4>
        <p>
            Whether they star as a furriendly fuzzball or crrrageous companion, cats and dogs have been featured in
            movies
            as early as the 19th century! Through their close relationship with humans, cats and dogs have made an
            appearance
            in thousands of movies and TV shows, acting in roles as funny, intelligent, and cute creatures!
        </p>

            But their
            influence doesn’t stop there. From viral internet memes and brand mascots to pet adoption campaigns and
            booming pet product industries, cats and dogs continue to shape the way we express affection, humor, and
            companionship in modern life. Our data visualizations explore how these beloved animals compare across
            different realms — from media popularity and adoption rates to the growing market that revolves around them.

            It is undeniable that dogs are the more popular pet in the United States according to 2024 statistics from
            the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). While this is likely not a casual relationship, there
            does seem

            Shelter stats. This will focus on average cat and dog adoptions to show that cats actually get adopted more
            than dogs from shelters even though they're not as popular. Means that they're still a key player and it is
            so unfair how we have Paw Patrol but not Cat Patrol #justiceforcats
            <br>
            Also this also means that a lot of dog parents aren't getting them from shelters which shows
            how when people get dogs they're going for specific characteristics which makes sense given how humans
            breeded dogs for specific desires which is also sad. #justicefordogs #adoptdontshop
            <br>
            Also will be a linked view similar to Lab 7 where you can select different states and see data. It's going
            to be the best US choropleth map you've ever seen trusttttt. But right now all you get to see is a map
            of the United States so stay tuned :3
            <br>
            Also if I do choropleth do we really want to stick to the orange and blue color scheme...

        <p>
            Maybe put a little research graph here and/or breed info to show how there's a lot more research on dogs and
            breeds which isn't just because dogs are popular (like they're popular because we fully domesticated them
            so it makes sense why there's so much research and human-created breeds). So ya that's why the
            shelter stats might be like that.
