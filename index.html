        <h4> Animals in Cinema </h4>
        <p>
            Whether they star as a furriendly fuzzball or crrrageous companion, cats and dogs have been featured in
            movies
            as early as the 19th century! Through their close relationship with humans, cats and dogs have made an
            appearance
            in thousands of movies and TV shows, acting in roles as funny, intelligent, and cute creatures!

            But their
            influence doesn’t stop there. From viral internet memes and brand mascots to pet adoption campaigns and
            booming pet product industries, cats and dogs continue to shape the way we express affection, humor, and
            companionship in modern life. Our data visualizations explore how these beloved animals compare across

        <p>
            Even though dogs are the more popular pet, cats are more likely to be adopted from a shelter. We think the
            reason behind this is because <a
                href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/442154-why-are-there-so-many-dog-breeds-but-only-a-few-cat-breeds">there
                are much more dog breeds than cat breeds</a>.
            Dogs are breeded for specific purposes (that's why there's so many more breeds of dogs!),
            so it's not unreasonable to think that when someone wants to adopt a dog,
            they'd rather get a specific breed from a breeder than go to a shelter. (Extra credit: Go ask a cat owner
            what breed their cat is.
            They'll likely say something like, "I don't know. Orange." Then ask a dog owner what breed their dog is. We
            bet that the dog owner will
            probably know what breed their dog is!)

        <h4> Pet Products Overview </h4>

            Data shows that almost twice the number of Dog toys were offered on the Market compared to Cat toys.
        </p>
        <div id="shopping-cart-viz"></div>

        <p>

        <p>
            <br>
            Evidently, Cat owners are way disadvantaged compared to Dog owners. But that does not have to be true.
        </p>
        <div id="trade-bars-viz"></div>
        <p>
            When the Average Trade Amounts are compared, Cat owners actually beat the Dog owners by almost 1.5 times!
            Although, Cat owners are provided a smaller number of options, they prove to be more dedicated and
            passionate,
            buying the same products in higher quantities. Cat owners don't lack love nor care, just the lack of
            options!
            With a bit more media attention, and more marketing focus on cats, we can welcome a catty tomorrow, a feline
            future for all!
