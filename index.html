                From movies like <em>Mr. Peabody and Sherman</em> to shows like <em>Family Guy</em>,
                <strong>dogs</strong> have been entertaining audiences for decades.
                At the same time, <strong>cats</strong> have had their fair share of the spotlight too, starring in
                classics like <em>Puss in Boots</em> and <em>Garfield</em>.

            </p>

                Movies can be a pretty good indicator of the public's sentiment of both
                cats and dogs. However, that isn't the only way that we can analyze this question. Let's take a deep

            Cats and dogs are both popular social media animals because they are adorable!
            Many people in the United States own cats or dogs, so it’s common for them to
            post their favorite pet on social media. From longer video platforms like
            YouTube to short video apps like Instagram and TikTok, cats and dogs are
            everywhere! So the real question is: how popular are cats and dogs in social media?

        <p>
            Even though dogs are the more popular pet, cats are more likely to be adopted from a shelter. We think the
            reason behind this is because <a
                href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/442154-why-are-there-so-many-dog-breeds-but-only-a-few-cat-breeds">there
                are much more dog breeds than cat breeds</a>.
            Dogs are breeded for specific purposes (that's why there's so many more breeds of dogs!),
            so it's not unreasonable to think that when someone wants to adopt a dog,
            they'd rather get a specific breed from a breeder than go to a shelter. (Extra credit: Go ask a cat owner
            what breed their cat is.
            They'll likely say something like, "I don't know. Orange." Then ask a dog owner what breed their dog is. We
            bet that the dog owner will
            probably know what breed their dog is!)

            Data shows that almost twice the number of Dog toys were offered on the Market compared to Cat toys.

        </p>
        <div id="trade-bars-viz"></div>
        <p>
            When the Average Trade Amounts are compared, Cat owners actually beat the Dog owners by almost 1.5 times!
            Although, Cat owners are provided a smaller number of options, they prove to be more dedicated and
            passionate,
            buying the same products in higher quantities. Cat owners don't lack love nor care, just the lack of
            options!
            With a bit more media attention and greater product emphasis on cats, more cats may find themselves with warm homes, comfortable lives, and loving owners.

            From movie screens to social media and the spaces we share every day, cats and dogs have found a
            way to stay close to our hearts. Their stories make us laugh, comfort us when we’re down, and
            remind us what it means to care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you’re a cat lover, a dog enthusiast, or both, these animals have shaped our culture in
            ways that go beyond entertainment. They bring people together, spark kindness, and make the
            world a little brighter.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight:600; color:#5c5ccc;">
            So go give your pet a hug, visit a local shelter, or share a story that makes someone smile.
            Every small act of care keeps the tale of two tails going strong.
